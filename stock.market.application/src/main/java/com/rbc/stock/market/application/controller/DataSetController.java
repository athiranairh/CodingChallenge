 * client understand the exact error and they can handle exceptions effectively
 * 
 * For the current requirement, since we have only POST (adds new entries in DB) and GET method (gets info from DB), 
 * there shouldn't be any concurrent access issues.
 * 
 * in order to avoid any concurrent access anomalies in future (may be by the introduction of a PUT method), optimistic locking with
 * the help of JPA @Version is implemented
 * 
 * in the GET request, an ETag is returned in the response header indicating the
 * version of the resource.
 * 
 * Later in a subsequent PUT request, the client can pass this value back in
 * request header under If-Match and can be checked for correct version of the
 * resource
